# 📘 Data Structures Lab – MIT Manipal

This repository contains all Data Structures laboratory programs from **Semester 3**, implemented in **C**.
Each lab focuses on understanding core data structure operations and algorithmic problem-solving without relying on prebuilt libraries.

## 🔹 Contents

**LAB 1–3:** Searching, Sorting, Matrices, and Recursion  
**LAB 4–6:** Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists  
**LAB 7–8:** Stacks and Queues (Array & Linked List Implementations)  
**LAB 9–10:** Binary Trees, BSTs, and AVL Trees  
**LAB 11:** Graph Representations and Traversals (BFS, DFS, Cycle Detection, Bipartite Check)


Each lab also includes an `additional_questions` folder with extended problem-solving exercises.
